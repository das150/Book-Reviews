*Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad*

I've read and written about this book before, but I really wanted to revisit it, and I'm glad I did. The first time I read this book, I had to annotate it (which really sucks the fun out of everything). This time, however, I was able to thoroughly enjoy the book, and I ironically took more away from it than when I had to stop and write about each page. I found the book's theme very pertinent to today's world, especially in imperial America. Here's a quick summary:

Against the untamed landscape of the African Congo, Conrad skillfully reveals the dehumanization and alienation stemming from the European imperialists' brutal exploitation and manipulation. Through the recurring motifs of darkness and light, alongside the Company's chilling machinations and the intricate character portrayals of Marlow and Kurtz, Conrad offers piercing critiques of imperialism's insidious effects. Conrad's personal history with his homeland, subjugated by imperial powers, and his background in the British Merchant Navy saturate the narrative with a profound skepticism towards colonial endeavors and European superiority. Conrad skillfully reveals the commodification of both land and people, illustrating the pervasive dehumanization inherent in imperialist endeavors. Through the intricate characters of Marlow and Kurtz and the portrayal of the Company's ruthless pursuit of profit, Conrad exposes the inherent alienation of imperialism. 

Ultimately, Heart of Darkness is a critique of imperialism that urges readers to confront the human cost of unchecked power and exploitation in the relentless pursuit of profitâ€”a theme as relevant today as it was in Conrad's time. While I didn't think the depiction of Kurtz's greed and despotism reflected reality (Heart of Darkness focuses on individual corruption rather than systemic exploitation; that is, imperialism's evils are presented as not mainly economic exploitation but the personal moral failings and desires of those in power).
